# Data-Analyzing-and-Summarizing-System
The System being proposed deals with statistical analysis. The Functionalities we include are summarization, analysis and modelling of data. Summarization deals with computing the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance and mean deviation of the given data using standard, conventional formulae. The system performs fundamental data analysis using statistical concepts such as covariance, correlation, point biserial correlation and formation of contingency tables. We extract results from the analysis phase and in turn, apply them to the data modelling phase to perform simple future predictions. Algorithms such as linear regression, which is the linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables, is being applied to perform future predictions based on the analytical results obtained from the previous (analysis) phase. Furthermore, the outcomes from the correlation analysis are used to find the principal components of the dataset and the potential relationships between various combinations of data attributes.
